            <p class="para1">The training program named “RASTER 2023” from 11-15 September 2023 is planned to highlight
                all the Recent and Latest Emerging Space-based Technologies and their application for the monitoring of
                Hydro-Climatological extremes. The aim is to Comprehend diverse satellite-derived products, evaluate
                their accuracy, understand the best-suited product, and leverage their utility through systematic
                assessments. The main goal is to apply a diverse range of software, models, and algorithms to
                effectively apply these satellite-derived products to extreme events, providing comprehensive analysis,
                interpretation, and utilization for enhanced understanding and decision-making.
                <span> <br>
                    <br> </span>
                Our training program aims to maximize the utilization of space technology, Useful algorithms, and
                software while providing recommendations to enhance regional disaster management and emergency response
                efforts. We will also seek insights from experts on historical perspectives and future scenarios, with
                participation from various domains in space technology and Hydro-Climatological extremes.
                <span> <br>
                    <br> </span>
                The program offers conceptual and practical training to enhance understanding of space products for
                earth science applications, including evaluation, corrections, and utilization for compound extremes.
                Hands-on training develops skills for early career researchers, advancing science communication
