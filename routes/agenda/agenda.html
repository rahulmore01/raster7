                    The training program "RASTER 2023" has been divided into different segments comprising lectures,
                    demonstrations, hands-on sessions, and small tasks, to cover the entire five-day course. Each day of
                    the course is scheduled for a total of *** hours, split into two sessions - one in the morning and
                    one in the afternoon, with each session lasting ** hours. The primary objective is to gain a
                    comprehensive understanding of various satellite-derived products, assess their accuracy through
                    systematic evaluations, identify the product that best fits the required purpose, and use their
                    potential to the fullest extent possible.

                <p class="para2">Extreme events such as occurring in form of heavy precipitation, droughts, and floods are natural hazards that occur globally, affecting the civilization’s future and human welfare. These events result from complex interactions between various physical processes across different scales. To investigate these compound extremes, space technology provides a better solution, as satellite products (precipitation, temperature, topography) are readily available online for free. However, the utility and awareness of these products among scientists, practitioners, and stakeholders are still in the early stages. Additionally, the risks arising from extreme events go beyond the expertise of a single research group or institute, requiring interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts to enhance scientific discovery. Despite clear benefits, such efforts are currently limited.

                        Department of Water Resource Development and Management is organizing a training program based on Advancements on Space Technology Applications for Hydro-Climatological Extremes (RASTER 2023) from 11-15 September 2023, as part of its technical discourse cause funded by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Department of Space, Government of India. We have distinguished experts to share their knowledge with a broader audience and discuss strengthening the latest advancements and collaborative research. RASTER 2023 is planned to draw attention to the multidisciplinary aspect of the remote sensing and Hydro-climatological extremes domain to the Working professionals of Various Indian Government and Semi-Government organizations.
